# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
This repository is my solution to `Project 1` of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). In this project, I built a Neural Network from scratch using NumPy to predict daily bike rental ridership based on historical data.
